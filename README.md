Holographic Image REconstruction

My Summer project involves working with the Swansea University Physics Department's Holography Lab.
I will be working on reconstructing images of ultracold atoms in near real time. I expect this project will take significant time to develop but I am hopeful that I will be able to document my work here.

The Project is aptly named 'HIRE' for Holographic Image REconstruction.

This project will be writting primarilly in the C programming language and will involve some GPU acceleration on the more complex Fourier Transformations
